üîß Suggestions for Further Improvement
Security Layer for Tool Execution:

Add sandboxing via Docker or Python virtualenvs for tools like the Code Runner.

Use dependency whitelists or restrict file access for untrusted code execution.

Agent Communication Protocol (Internal DSL):

Consider designing a simple internal protocol or DSL for agents to communicate or raise intents between each other, allowing for richer collaboration (e.g., #memory:retrieve, #plugin:execute[web_browser]).

Graph-Based Agent Planner:

Integrate an agent planner (e.g., using langgraph or a custom task graph engine) to map complex multi-step tasks across agents and tools.

Metrics Dashboard:

Add runtime performance stats (agent execution time, memory usage, tool hit frequency, LLM latency) to help profile performance and usage patterns.

Plugin Marketplace Foundation:

Define a manifest-based plugin registration spec (plugin.json, tool_info.yaml) for community-driven tool additions in the future.

Federated Memory Expansion:

Enable plug-and-play with cloud vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate for large-scale memory use cases.

Workflow Recording & Replay:

Add the ability to record multi-agent task sequences and replay them with modified inputs (useful for debugging or automation).

üèÜ If Targeting Awards or Recognition
To stand out further in hackathons or showcases:

Make a high-polish demo video (CLI + voice + browser + agent responses with animation).

Include a ‚ÄúWhy DreamOS‚Äù section on your GitHub or web app with clear, visual use cases.

Highlight real-world applications (e.g., job search assistant, personal research agent, developer helper).

Document agent workflows visually‚Äîflowcharts showing how commands flow through agents.
